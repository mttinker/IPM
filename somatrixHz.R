  #SOMATRIX function to generate 4x4 projection matrix for sea otters
  #  (2 age classes for 2 sexes = 4stage) using proportional hazards
  #  with density dependenze, possible additional additive hazards and 
  #  environmental stochasticity
  #
  # EXPLANATION:
  # Uses proportional hazards formulation to estimate survival
  #   gamma = exp(sum(zeta0 + zeta1 + zeta2... + AiHz + eps))
  #   Sx = exp(-gamma)
  #     where AiHz = user supplied additional additive hazards 
  #     (which can be = 0 if no additional hazards)
  #     and eps = stochasticity, eps~rnorm(1,0,sigma)
  #     (if user-supplied sigma=0 then no stochasticity)
  # NOTE: user-supplied sigma represents std dev in log haz,
  #  and is ~5x larger than associated sd of log(lambda) 
  #
  # Produces a 2-sex matrix for 2 age classes,
  #  Sub-adults: 0.5-2.5 yr olds (2 year stage duration)
  #  Adults: 2.5-19.5 year olds (17 year stage duration)
  #  (assumes first pup born to females on 3rd birthday)
  # INPUT: vector of 8 elements containing vital rates:
  #  br = birth rates for adult females
  #  wr = weaning success rate for adult females
  #  fs = female survival rates (stages J and A)
  #  ms = male survival rates (stages J and A)
  # OUTPUT:
  # lambda = algebraic value of lambda
  # ssd = associated stable stage distribution  
  # M = 4 by 4 projection matrix
  # vrts = vector of vital rates
